SoftLayer (IBM Cloud) API tools

This is a small set of standalone programs that interface with SoftLayer's
API, which we have found useful at End Point. Important links:

http://www.softlayer.com/ - SoftLayer's main website
http://sldn.softlayer.com/ - API information and documentation

The scripts run on different servers, with different API keys each having
the minimum required privileges at SoftLayer, so we've so far seen no
need to make a shared library or any separate configuration file to
store the API key.
